building:
=========

download source from svn, and then configure and build it:
#./autogen.sh
#patch < patches/configure-fix-arm-elf-build.path
#./build-arm.sh
#make

The generated bin is src/xmux, copy src/xmux to snapgear/romfs/home,
and in the snapgear dir, emit:
#make image
to make the target image.2510.img
