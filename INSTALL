First of all, the SNAPGEAR in build-arm.sh must be set to you snapgear path.

Then configure which mux channel we wanted:
#./build-arm.sh <channel number, default is 8, support:1, 4, 8>

And build the source:
#make

At last generate the target image.2510.img in /tftpboot:
#make image

More detail information please ref doc/Build.txt.
