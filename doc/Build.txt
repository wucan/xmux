xmux building and deploying
============================

1. Get source from svn reop
#svn co https://192.168.1.126/svn/复用器/软件源码/xmux xmux

2. Then go into the source directory
#cd xmux

3. prepare the building enviroment
#./autogen.sh
#patch -p 0 < patches/configure-fix-arm-elf-build.patch
#./build-arm.sh <channel number, default is 8, suuport:1, 4, 8>

4. compiling it
#make

5. build image for burning to 2510
After a success build of above, there will be a binary file src/xmux, you should copy it to snapgear/romfs/home/, replace the old one, and then in the snapgear directory, issue command to build the image:
#make image
and the generate image is /tftpboot/image.2510.img
But note that I had add a shortcut target in Makefile to build target image, so
in xmux/ root dir, just run:
#make image

6. write to 2510
In the armboot of 2510 sheel, at first download the image from tftp server:
#tftp
And then write it to flash:
#flwrite 81000000 1
If you just want the image run from memory but not burn to flash(test mode):
#bootm
